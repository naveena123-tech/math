    <h3>Addition</h3>

    <p>The addition is taking two or more numbers and adding them together, that is, it is the total sum of 2 or more numbers. Example: How many apples are there in all? There are 7 apples in one basket and 4 apples in the other. Answer: 7 apples + 4 apples = 11 apples</p>

    <h3>Subtraction</h3>
    <p>Subtraction is the operation of taking the difference of two numbers and Example: In 7 Bananas 3 bananas were eaten how many are left? Answer 7 â€“ 3 = 4, the number 7 is the minuend, the number 3 is the subtrahend and the number 4 is the difference.

    <h3>Multiplication</h3>
    <p>Multiplication is when you take one number and add it together a number of times. Example: Sara want to give 2 ballons for each kid at a party there were 6 kids at the party. How many ballons does she need to buy? Answer: 2 x 6 = 12 ballons . We took the number 2 and added it together 6 times.</p>

    <h3>Division</h3>
    <p>
        Division is the process of breaking a number up into equal parts, and finding out how many equal parts can be made.Example: A pizza was cut into 6 slices and 3 people want to share that pizza equally. how many slices do each person get? . Answer: 6/3 = 2 so each person gets 2 slices. </p>

    <h2>Decimals</h2>
    <h3>Defintion</h3>
    <p>A decimal number can be defined as a number whose whole number part and the fractional part is separated by a decimal point. The dot in a decimal number is called a decimal point. Example: The Weight of 6 apples is 1.30 kg, here, 30 represents grams and 1 represents kg . </p>

    <h2>Integers</h2>
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>
        An integer is a whole number that can be positive, negative, or zero. Examples of integers are: -5, 1, 5, 8, 97, and 3,043. Examples of numbers that are not integers are: -1.43, 1 3/4, 3.14, . 09, and 5,643.1.

    <h3>Arranging numbers on a number line </h3>
    <p> Integers on the number line are arranged in ascending order from left to right. On the number line, moving to the right is positive. On the number line, moving to the left is negative.</p>

    <h2>Fractions</h2>
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>A fraction is a part of a whole number, and a way to split up a number into equal parts. It is written as the number of equal parts being counted, called the numerator, over the number of parts in the whole, called the denominator. These numbers are separated by a line.Example: An Apple is cut into a half and been eaten by Maya so the part left is 2/4</p>

    <h2>Algebra</h2>
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>Algebra is the branch of mathematics that helps in the representation of problems or situations in the form of mathematical expressions. It involves variables like x, y, z, and mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to form a meaningful mathematical expression.
     Example: x + y = z , 3x = 6 etc.</p>

    <h2>Ratio</h2>
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p> A ratio indicates how many times one number contains another. For example, if there are eight oranges and six lemons in a bowl of fruit, then the ratio of oranges to lemons is eight to six. Similarly, the ratio of lemons to oranges is 6:8 and the ratio of oranges to the total amount of fruit is 8:14. A Ratio is Shown Using the Symbol ':'. More examples are 2:3 , 4:6 , 3:7 </p>

    <h2>Perimeter and Area</h2>
    <h3>Perimeter Definition</h3>
    <p>
Perimeter is the total length of the sides of a two-dimensional shape. In a Rectangle To Calculate a Perimeter, we use the formula 2(l+b) Which means 2 x ( length + breadth ) so if the rectangle's l=5cm and b=4cm the Perimeter is 18cm. In a Square all the sides are equal, so the formula for perimeter is 4xs which is 4 x side. If a square's side is 6cm the perimter will be 24cm </p>

    <h3>Area Definition</h3>
    <p>The area in maths is the amount of space taken up by a 2D shape. In a Rectangle The Primeter formula is Lxb Which Means Length x breadth so if L=3cm B=2cm the Area is 6cm. In a square The Area formula is  S x S which is Side x Side. If Side= 4cm, Area=16cm</p>
